# Content Structure
## 1. Your talk as an experience ‚≠êÔ∏è

Sometimes we need to be clear with the goals of our presentation. Start with answer the follow questions allows you to be focused on the main goal of your talk. Remember that have 20-50 minutes is really few time to explain many things. 

| Questions | Reason |
|:----:|:---:| 
| 1. What it's the **main topic**? | Choose just 1 idea that you want to explain. Keep it simple. |
| 2. Who are your **audience**? (novices, experts, general public, developers, managers, etc...)| Define the people who are you going to talk. |
| 3. What it's the **main message** that you want to communicate to your audience? | Think on what do you want to encourage the people who are listen to you. |

Example:

| Your Talk Title | The BEAM Processes |
|:----:|:---:| 
| What it's the **main topic**? | Show how a BEAM process works. |
| Who are your **audience**? | Developers with experience in Erlang/Elixir with few knowledge about OTP. |
| What it's the **main message** that you want to communicate to your audience? | Learn processes it's a great way to start to understand how BEAM works. |

## 2. Define your Audiences ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Define the kind of audience that you're looking for motivate about your speech will allow you to prepare better material and put emphasis on the important remarks on your talk. The audience it's part of the main goals of your talk, keep in mind this.

| Audiences | Definition |
|:----:|:----:|
| Main audience | The people that you're looking to convince about your talk main topic. |
| Intermediate Audience | People with few context of your topic. |
| Beginner Audience | People without context of your topic. |

Why it's important to define this? Because if you want to be sure more people it's undertanding you, you need to take care of them. Any audience has many different kinds of levels involved. You can planning better your content and make sure everybody is following you during your talk.

Example:

| Audiences | Definition |
|:----:|:----:|
| Main audience | Developers with experience in Erlang/Elixir with few knowledge about OTP. |
| Intermediate Audience | Developers starting his journey in Erlang/Elixir. |
| Beginner Audience | Developers without any context about the BEAM world. |

## 3. The Technical Content considerations üèóÔ∏è

Structure content is complex, but if you have in mind the previous points about your goals and your audiences, you'll be able to structure a better sequence of ideas to present.

- Keep in mind the duration. The technical talks have few time to explain many things.
- Keep it simple, less is more.
- You're building a learning space between you and your audience. You're not alone, you're a guide for them.
- Technical content is hard to follow.
- Emphatize with your audience. Don't assume everyone is understanding you.
- Experiment, iterate, make retrospectives and improve.

If you want to improve the story behind your talk I strongly recommend you to check the dialectics method.

After structure your content, you can answer this questions and improve it:

- What are the 5 concepts to understand your main topic?
- Can you measure how much your audience is understanding you?
- How can you achieve everyone is really understanding your main topic?
- How many summaries did you include in your presentation? 

## 4. Emphatize through your experience üíñ

- Technical content is complex. 
- Learning is a complex, and it's not a lineal process. 
- You're building a brigde between your content and your audience.
- Share a personal achievement where you can mix your content and your experience could be the perfect bridge.

## 5. Call to Action üî•

Before to finish your presentation, consider share a complement to extend your content:

- Courses, videos and books recommendations.
- Create a public repository on GitHub to share your references.
- Create a small guide with the next steps to learn this. (It could be a tutorial or a blog post)
- Prepare a set of most common questions with the anwswers.  

You can create a [QR code](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/) to share easily this. This moment is a great point to interact with the audience.

## 6. The Story Script

After design all your content you'll be able to add notes in every slide. Altough this could be a hard work, this a great way to improve all your communication skills.

1. In a document, you can use google docs or word, add all the slides. 
2. Slide by slide, add all you speech: every word that you are going to say should be here. This is your story script.
3. Don't forget add anything that you're going to say here. (It's like TDD!)
4. Read your script and recognize your speech. Maybe after this step you will want to modify your content. Be your own audience.
